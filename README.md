## Life Story

### App Description
// TODO: Essentially makes it so a bunch of random people can share their life stories and possibly help someone who’s going through that problem right now. It can also bring a good laugh and lighten up someone’s day.
### App Idea Evaluation
// TODO: Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.

- Mobile: Allows use of camera and audio to tell the stories
- Story: The values come from the stories and the people telling them. Peers would respond well to this product idea, pecause they like to hear stories
- Market: Whoever has a phone, and enjoys stories.No well defined audience, usable by all
- Habit: Pretty addictive, people are curious about other's lives, so they'll want to keep chacking up on them.. Users would both consume and create.
- Scope:Preety good scope, it would be somewhat difficult, but impossible. Yes, the core idea is still there in the stripped-down version. Pretty well defined.
